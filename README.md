🇺🇦Made with love in Ukraine, but for the past few years, I’ve been living in the 🇨🇿 Czech Republic and 🇦🇹 Austria.

🐍 I met Python 4 years ago, and we’ve been inseparable ever since.

🍵 Instead of coffee, I prefer guarana granules.

🎧  I love writing efficient code and listening to Enigma (it’s more than just music)😎.
